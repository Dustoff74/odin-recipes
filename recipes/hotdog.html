            <h2>This regional specialty has a unique sauce which is typically slightly chunkier 
                and thicker than most hot dog sauces. You'll often find this served on top-split buns, 
                but regular hot dog buns will work. There are many versions of this sauce, but this is 
                the way we like ours.</h2>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Brown ground beef and 1/3 cup onion in a large skillet 
                        over medium heat, until the meat is no longer pink, 5 to 7 
                        minutes. Drain, and return the skillet to the stove.</li>
                    <li>Stir tomato sauce and ketchup into the ground beef mixture. 
                        Add chili powder, vinegar, garlic powder, hot sauce, salt, 
                        and pepper; stir until well combined. Reduce heat to low and 
                        simmer uncovered until sauce has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. 
                        If sauce gets too thick, add water to thin it out.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile steam or simmer hot dogs in hot water until hot.</li>
                    <li>Assemble hot dogs: Place a hot dog in a bun and spoon 2 to 3 
                        tablespoons sauce on top. Sprinkle with remaining onions and 
                        drizzle with yellow mustard.</li>
